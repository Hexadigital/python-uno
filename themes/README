Themes can be placed in here.

Each theme must contain the following functions:

names - A list of names for the CPUs and player.

PreIntro() - A function that plays before the dealer puts the card down.

DealerText() - A function that displays when the dealer puts the card down.

PostIntro() - A function that plays after the dealer puts the card down.



Optionally, you can define the following functions:

RandomEvent() - A function that plays after each CPU turn. It is recommended that you use randint from the random library to determine the chance of the event happening.



Please see the included themes for examples.
