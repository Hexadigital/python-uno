Themes can be placed in here.

Each theme must contain the following functions:

names - A list of names for the CPUs and player.

playercount - The number of players in your theme. (must be between 2 and 8)

playerpickfirstwild - If the dealer places a wild, should the player pick the color? 1 for yes, 0 for no.

PreIntro() - A function that plays before the dealer puts the card down.

DealerText() - A function that displays when the dealer puts the card down.

PostIntro() - A function that plays after the dealer puts the card down.



Optionally, you can define the following functions:

RandomEvent() - A function that plays after each CPU turn. It is recommended that you use randint from the random library to determine the chance of the event happening.
